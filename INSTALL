For Unix

   In most cases you should use:
   CFLAGS=your best optimizing switches
   export CFLAGS
    #note that first two lines are usually not needed in case you use
    #gnu c compiler where AA-lib uses quite good ones automatically
   ./configure
   make
   make install

   see help for configure in case of problems

For DOS:
   you need to compile vga/text libraries:
   (available at AA-lib homepage http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib/)
     cd ../vga
     make
     cd ../text
     make

   then you can finally compile AA-lib

     cd os2 ; make -f makefile.dos

   then you should copy libaa.a libvga.a or libtext.a to your lib directory
   and libaa.h to your include directory

   All programs in AA-project expects AA-lib,vga and text archive in
   uncompressed and compiled in same directory as sources of them
