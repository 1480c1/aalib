  o	AAsave extensions by Tim Newsome:
  	o	AAsave now accepts %x %y in filename for pages
		You have to use %% for %
	o	Format now specifies conversion list - so conversions
		like & -> &amp; should be done ellegantly
	o	added . to extension name - should be usefull to specify
		no extensions etc..
	o	New formats: irc, zephyr and roff
	Revisions of this patch by Jan Hubicka
	o	AAsave now accepts %e for extension and %c for string
		_%x_%y in case extensions is used (so you might simply
		add %c%e after filename to get nice results)
	o	extension field of structure returned back for backward
		compatibility and since I think it is good place to hold
		default extension for given type. It is not added by default
		now, but at %e command in filename
	o	Conversion list format changed from [500] array, since
		it increased executable file size too much. Used pointer to 
		pointer instead.
	o	For one page formats pointer to FILE * structure should be
		passed instad of filename
	o	Added new formats into formats list
	o	Changed conversions mechanizm a bit to avoid unfreed memory
		areas.
	o	Avoided conflict in case multiple aa_save filters are up
		and in threads and some other problems
  o	AA-lib is now under LGPL! 
 API Uncompatibilities: hope last ones for long time :) - better to do them
                        sooner than wait :)
  o	X driver now uses default size (w/o asking) since it is not
  	usual in X11. Use command line options instead :)
  o	AA_getkey now returns just keypresses. Not releases anymore
  	(was bug)
  o	Removed update driver call since it is generaly unused.
  o	stupid typo - MAKS renamed to MASK
  o	You need to add %c%e at the end of name fileld for aa_save to
  	get correct results (see comments bellow)
  o	fontxx renamed to aa_fontxx to avoid confusion with other 
  	symbols
  o	context->driver->params moved into context->driverparams since
  	one driver should handle multiple devices with different parameters
	driverparams is taken as parameter into init
	(broke compatibility with old aview. New aview is comming soon!)
 New port:
  o	OS2 port by Thomas A. K. Kjaer
